Exercise R.1: Use CHUNK 1 to load the gapminder data into an object.

```{r}
# CHUNK 1
# Read the data into an object called "data.full"

```

CHUNK 2 provides space to complete Exercise R.1.

```{r}
# CHUNK 2
# Write your R code here.

```

CHUNK 3 contains a sample solution to Exercise R.1.

```{r}
# CHUNK 3
# Sample solution

# Read the data into an object called data.full:
data.full <- read.csv("gapminderdatafiveyear.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Do some basic exploration.
colnames(data.full)
data.full[1:10, ]
summary(data.full)
# The function sapply is discussed in Chapter 11 of R for Everyone. It is not required for this course. Alternatives to get the class for each variable are to write a loop or simply a separate command for each variable.
sapply(data.full, class)
```
